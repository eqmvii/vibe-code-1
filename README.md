# WINDSURF VIBE CODING MAXIMUM COMDEDY:

app lives at: http://localhost:5173/

* Asked Windsurf to create app containerized app with Vue around 10:30am
* It did, eventually
* Now trying to move app to WSL directories which is ambitious
* That was dumb and wrong, gave up.
* Got git and SSH keys working in windows, now pushed as hoped to https://github.com/eqmvii/vibe-code-1
* lfg 
* Well that was a long walk. Ran in circles with a completely insane and broken dockerfile and dockercompose "architecture." Deleted everything and rebuilt one small prompt at a time and got there. Now 12:19pm, got some food. 
* switched to chat mode, it tried chatting with me and adding random features but couldn't edit code. It seemed to think it could? 5 billion app lfg
* Make it pretty: "Now let's style the whole app. Please make it black and white and grey, futuristic looking, like an apple product released in 2030."
